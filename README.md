# About
Welcome to the Recipe App! This WPF-based application seeks to make it easier to manage and scale recipes. Whether you're an experienced chef or an aspiring cook, this software makes it easy to enter, display, scale, reset, and clear recipe information. With a visually appealing and intuitive layout, users can easily enter ingredients, quantities, and steps for their recipes, view them in an organized format, scale them up or down as needed, and reset quantities.

The Recipe Application addresses the frequent challenge of managing recipes efficiently. In the fast-paced world of cooking, keeping track of ingredients, quantities, and steps across multiple recipes can be daunting. This program streamlines the process by offering a structured interface that allows users to easily input, view, and change recipe details. Whether you're adjusting quantities for a larger meal or starting fresh with a new recipe, the Recipe Application simplifies the process, making cooking less stressful and more enjoyable.


# Features
- **Enter Recipe Details:** Add the ingredient's name, quantity, unit of measurement, calories, and food group. Specify preparation steps.
- **Display Recipe:** View all ingredients and steps of a recipe, along with total calories.
- **Scale Recipe:** Adjust ingredient quantities by a specified factor within this range (0.5, 2, 3).
- **Reset Quantities:** Reset ingredient quantities to their original values.
- **Clear Data:** Remove all recipes from the application.
- **Calorie Notification:** Get a warning if the total calories of a recipe exceed 300.
- **Alphabetical Recipe Display:** List all recipes in alphabetical order.
- **Food Group and Unit Enumeration:** Use enumerations for food groups and units of measurement for better data management.
- **Event Handling:** Notify users when a recipe exceeds 300 calories using event handlers.


# Sprint 2
All aspects were met for Prog, Part 1 of the POE. In Sprint 2, several enhancements and new features were added to the Recipe Application to improve its functionality and user experience. These changes include:

- **Original Quantity Storage:** Added a feature to store the original quantity of ingredients, allowing users to reset ingredient quantities to their initial values after scaling.
- **Enhanced Ingredient Input:** Improved the input process for ingredients by adding validations and detailed prompts for entering ingredient details, including name, quantity, unit of measurement, calories, and food group.
- **Event Handling for Calorie Notification:** Implemented an event handler to notify users when the total calories of a recipe exceed 300, enhancing user awareness of calorie content.
- **Alphabetical Sorting:** Added functionality to display all recipes in alphabetical order, making it easier for users to find and select recipes.
- **Console Menu Enhancements:** Provided a switch case for displaying the Food Group Options that are available to the user. This improved the console menu by providing clear and user-friendly options for interacting with the application and its features.
- **Code Refactoring:** Refactored the code to improve readability, maintainability, and performance, ensuring a more robust and efficient application.


# Sprint 3
Transitioning from a console application to a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application for recipe management has significantly enhanced user interaction and functionality. The WPF interface introduces a visually appealing and intuitive layout with tabbed navigation for Add Recipe, View Recipe, All Recipes, Scale Recipe, Reset Recipe, and Delete Recipe functionalities, ensuring organized and efficient task management. 

Utilizing UI elements such as text boxes, buttons, and combo boxes allows for seamless input and display of recipe details, ingredients, and steps, facilitating user-friendly data entry and retrieval. Features like scroll viewers, grids and stack panels ensure content is elegantly presented and easily accessible, while data binding and item templates optimize the dynamic display of ingredient lists and recipe steps. Overall, the transition to WPF enriches usability, visual appeal, and operational efficiency compared to a console application, offering a simple and interactive platform for recipe management.

All aspects were met for Prog, Part 2 of the POE. In Sprint 3, several enhancements and new features were added to the WPF Recipe Application to improve its functionality and user experience. These changes include:

The application will transition from a console-based application to a GUI (Graphical User Interface) using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation):

1. Users can navigate through different tabs to access various functions.
2. Users can view recipes before scaling them by factors of 0.5, 2, or 3.

3. Users will be able to filter the alphabetical list of recipes by:
- Entering the name of any ingredient from a recipe.
- Selecting a food group that the recipe belongs to.
- Selecting a maximum number of calories in a recipe.
